HTML5 Canvas Demo - Fractal (Sierpinski Triangle)
=================================================

Pretty self-explanatory - a rough-n-ready Sierpinski triangle generator using 
HTML5 and JavaScript. The algorithm is adapted from a website, I found it [here](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/sierpinski.html#With_Recursion_).

Produces some really pretty results. I like maths.


The copyright notice for the Sierpinski algorithm is [here](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/legal.html).
(I'm including it for completeness).
